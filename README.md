## Tracing

GatewayCore uses two headers to pass on trace identifiers to both the server and the client:

### Correlation-id header

A request originated from a client can include a correlation-id header that is passed on unchanged to the proxied server. The default correlation-id header is `x-correlation-id` but can be renamed as shown here:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "correlationIdHeader": "x-request-id",
```

In the case of a missing correlation-id header, GatewayCore generates a unique identifier instead.

The correlation-id header can also be added to the response message by explicitly enabling `includeCorrelationId`:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "downstreamResponse": {
          "headers": {
            "includeCorrelationId": true
```

It is also possible to omit this header from the request to the proxied server using `'ignoreCorrelationId'` as shown below:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "upstreamRequest": {
          "headers": {
            "ignoreCorrelationId": true,
```

### Call-id header

A unique call-id is generated and forwarded for every request received by GatewayCore. The header that is appended is `x-call-id` and can be removed from outbound upstream requests using `ignoreCallId`. It can also be included in responses sent to the client by enabling `includeCallId` as shown in the sample below:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "upstreamRequest": {
          "headers": {
            "ignoreCallId": true
          }
        },
        "downstreamResponse": {
          "headers": {
            "includeCallId": true
```

> An inbound call-id header received from the client or the proxied server is silently ignored.

## Route tracking

There are two types of route tracking, one that includes information about the proxies and one that provides for client details.

### Via header

A proxy typically uses the [`Via`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Via) header for tracking message forwards, avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of senders along the request/response chain.

This header is a comma-separated list of proxies along the message chain with the closest proxy to the sender being the left-most value.

The value added by GatewayCore includes the pseudonym of the proxy. This name is `gwcore` but can be customized, as shown below:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "proxyName": "my-proxy-name",
```

GatewayCore appends one of the following values:

| Sender's protocol | Value | Example |
|:--- |:--- |:-- |
| HTTP/1.0 | `1.0 \<proxy-name>` | `1.0 gwcore` |
| HTTP/1.1 | `1.1 \<proxy-name>` | `1.1 gwcore` |
| HTTP/2.0 | `2.0 \<proxy-name>` | `2.0 gwcore` |
| HTTP/X.Y | `X.Y \<proxy-name>` | `X.Y gwcore` |
| \<protocol>/\<version> | `<protocol>\<version> <proxy-name>` |  

> As per the above, GatewayCore omits the protocol for HTTP requests and responses.

The Via header is included by default on both the request to the proxied server and the response to the client. You can change this behavior using `ignoreVia` as shown below:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "upstreamRequest": {
          "headers": {
            "ignoreVia": true,
            }
          }
        },
        "downstreamResponse": {
          "headers": {
            "ignoreVia": true,
```

### Forwarded category of headers

The forwared class of headers contains information from the client-facing side of proxy servers that is altered or lost when a proxy is involved in the path of the request. This information is passed on using one of these techniques:

1. The [`Forwarded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) header is what GatewayCore uses by default. This is the standardized version of the header.
1. The [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For), [`X-Forwarded-Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host), and [`X-Forwarded-Proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto) headers which are considered the [de-facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) versions of the [`Forwared`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) header.

The information included in these headers typically consists of the IP address of the client, the IP address where the request came into the proxy server, the [`Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) request header field as received by the proxy, and the protocol used by the request (typically "http" or "https").

> IP V6 addresses are quoted and enclosed in square brackets.

GatewayCore uses the `Forwarded` header by default and replaces all inbound `X-Forwarded-*` headers. You can use `useXForwarded` to reverse this behavior and to prefer `X-Forwarded-*` headers instead:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "upstreamRequest": {
          "headers": {
            "useXForwarded": true,
```

It is also possible to not include any of these headers on proxy's outbound request by using `ignoreForwarded` as per below:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "/api/": {
      "proxy": {
        "to": "http://upstream/v1/",
        "upstreamRequest": {
          "headers": {
            "ignoreForwarded": true,
```
